    h3 Step 1: Declare

    p Create each layer as an entry in an enum. Replace YOUR_LAYER_1, YOUR_LAYER_2, etc., below, with names of your layers.
    aside in keymap.c:
    pre
      code.language-c.
        // Layer Declarations
        enum {
            YOUR_LAYER_1 = 0,
            YOUR_LAYER_2,
            // ..., the rest of your layers
        };
  .block
    h3 Step 2: Define

    p Add the keycodes for each layer into the keymaps array, by calling KEYMAP() for each layer.
    aside in keymap.c, create your KEYMAPs:
    pre
      code.language-c.
        // Layer Definitions
        const uint16_t PROGMEM keymaps[][MATRIX_ROWS][MATRIX_COLS] = {

          [YOUR_LAYER_1] = KEYMAP(
            // ... list all your keycodes here, separating each with comma
          ),

          [YOUR_LAYER_2] = KEYMAP(
            // ... list all your keycodes here, separating each with comma
          ),

          // ..., the rest of your layers

        };
  .block
    h3 Step 3: Use

    p Here are a variety of ways to change the layer.

    table
      thead
        tr
          td Keycode #[aside to be added to your call to KEYMAP()]
          td Description
      tr
        td
          pre
            code.language-c.
              MO(YOUR_LAYER)
        td While held, MOmentarily switch to YOUR_LAYER.
      tr
        td
          pre
            code.language-c.
              LT(YOUR_LAYER, KC_XXXX)
        td Layer Tap. When held: go to YOUR_LAYER. #[br] When tapped: send KC_XXXX
      tr
        td
          pre
            code.language-c.
              TG(YOUR_LAYER)
        td Layer Toggle. When tapped, toggles YOUR_LAYER on or off
      tr
        td
          pre
            code.language-c.
              TO(YOUR_LAYER)
        td When tapped, goes to YOUR_LAYER
      tr
        td
          pre
            code.language-c.
              TT(YOUR_LAYER)
        td When tapped, toggles YOUR_LAYER on or off. #[br] When held, activates YOUR_LAYER.
      tr
        td
          pre
            code.language-c.
              OSL(YOUR_LAYER)
        td One-Shot Layer. Goes to YOUR_LAYER for the next keypress

  .block
    h3 Light LEDs according to layer

    p Create a function called matrix_scan_user, and add a case for each layer. Note, you will have to look up which function your keyboard calls to turn LEDs on/off, and insert them to the code, below.
    aside in keymap.c:
    pre
      code.language-c.
        // Runs constantly in the background, in a loop.
        void matrix_scan_user(void) {

            uint8_t layer = biton32(layer_state);

            // INSERT CODE HERE: turn off all leds

            switch (layer) {
                case YOUR_LAYER_1:
                    // INSERT CODE HERE: turn on leds that correspond to YOUR_LAYER_1
                    break;
                case YOUR_LAYER_2:
                    // INSERT CODE HERE: turn on leds that correspond to YOUR_LAYER_2
                    break;
                // add case for each layer
            }
        };
